##Sales Data Analysis and RFM Segmentation

## Project Overview

This project focuses on Sales Data Analysis and RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) segmentation to analyze customer behavior. The goal is to extract valuable insights from sales data and categorize customers based on their purchasing patterns, helping the marketing team optimize retention and engagement strategies.

## Problem Statement

Businesses often accumulate vast amounts of sales data but struggle to derive actionable insights. Without proper analysis, it becomes difficult to:

-Identify high-value customers and their purchasing behavior.

-Detect customers at risk of churn and take preventive actions.

-Personalize marketing campaigns based on customer spending patterns.

- Optimize customer retention strategies to increase revenue.

This project aims to solve these challenges by analyzing sales data using SQL and applying RFM segmentation to categorize customers into meaningful groups, such as Loyal Customers, At-Risk Customers, and Potential Churners.

## Solution Approach

Sales Data Analysis: Perform initial data exploration, cleaning, and aggregation using SQL.

RFM Scoring: Assign Recency, Frequency, and Monetary scores to customers based on their transaction history.

Segmentation: Group customers into categories for better marketing strategies.

View Creation: Store the segmentation results in a SQL view (rfm_segmentation_view) for easy access.

Exporting Results: Save the results in a CSV file for the marketing team's use.

## Technologies Used

SQL (MySQL): Data manipulation, analysis, and segmentation queries.

Python (Pandas, SQLAlchemy): Data extraction and exporting results to CSV.

Jupyter Notebook: SQL execution and data analysis.



## Future Improvements

- Integrate a dashboard for visualization.

- Extend segmentation with machine learning models.
